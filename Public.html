        <td>Pinang left to go look for the ladle but didn't come back home. Aling Rosa went looking for her and asked the neighbors where she went but no one saw her. One day, an unexpected flower suddenly showed up at her house and she took care of it. It grew head-shaped with many eyes, she remembered what she said to her daughter and named it Pinang and altered it to Pinya.</td>
        
        <td>Pinang and her mom got into a disagreement after Pinang couldn't find the ladle. Pinang's mom told her, "Naku! Pinang, sana'y magkaroon ka ng maraming mata upang makakita mo and lahat ng bagay at hindi ka na tanong nang tanong sa akin." This soon became a curse once Pinang was lost. Pinang came back as a fruit we now call "pinya" on her mother's backyard.</td>
